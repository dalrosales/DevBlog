Welcome to my tech journal! I’m a software developer exploring technology from code to infrastructure, building applications, experimenting with homelab setups, and learning modern DevOps practices. Here you’ll find project write-ups, technical notes, and lessons learned as I grow my skills across software development, automation, and systems design.

title: About Me
---

I’m a software developer with a passion for building practical solutions and exploring the tools that power modern technology. My work spans application development, homelab infrastructure, and DevOps workflows, always with an eye toward learning and improving.

You’ll find me switching between writing C# code for my personal projects, spinning up containers in my homelab, and automating whatever repetitive task catches my eye. For me, technology is as much about solving problems as it is about the thrill of creating something new.

This site is where I document my projects, share lessons learned, and explore ideas in coding, infrastructure, automation, and system design. My goal is to keep growing as a developer while contributing knowledge that might help others along the way.
